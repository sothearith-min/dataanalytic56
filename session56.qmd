## Part 1: Data Collection Methods 📊

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 60px;"}
### "Garbage in, garbage out" {style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.8em;"}

Quality of your analysis depends on quality of your data!
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 💡 Key Insight
The **method** you use to collect data affects its reliability, cost, and suitability for your question!
:::

## Primary vs Secondary Data: Overview

| | **Primary Data** | **Secondary Data** |
|--|------------------|---------------------|
| **Definition** | Data you collect yourself for your specific purpose | Data collected by others for other purposes |
| **Source** | Surveys, experiments, interviews, observations | Reports, databases, articles, websites |
| **Control** | You design and control collection | Pre-existing; you have no control over collection |
| **Cost** | Usually higher (time, money) | Usually lower (often free) |
| **Relevance** | Tailored to your question | May need filtering or adaptation |

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Think of it as...
**Primary** = "I went out and got it." | **Secondary** = "Someone else already got it."
:::

## Primary Data: Characteristics

**You collect it first-hand for your own analysis.**

**Advantages:**

- ✅ Exactly fits your research question
- ✅ You know how it was collected (method, timing, sample)
- ✅ Fresh and current (if you collect recently)
- ✅ No copyright issues for your use

**Disadvantages:**

- ❌ Time-consuming and often expensive
- ❌ Requires design (survey, experiment, etc.)
- ❌ May need ethics approval or consent

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Use primary data when...
You need data that doesn't exist elsewhere or must be tailored (e.g. customer satisfaction for *your* product).
:::

## Primary Data: Common Methods

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Surveys & Questionnaires**

- Online forms, phone, paper
- Quantitative (ratings, counts) or qualitative (open text)
- Sample size and design matter

**Experiments**

- A/B tests, controlled trials
- Change one variable, measure effect
- Strong for causation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Interviews & Focus Groups**

- Deep, qualitative insights
- Small samples, rich detail

**Observations**

- Watch behavior (e.g. in-store, on website)
- No direct questions; real behavior
:::
:::

## Secondary Data: Characteristics

**Data that already exists; collected by others.**

**Advantages:**

- ✅ Usually faster and cheaper (or free)
- ✅ Large datasets (e.g. government, research)
- ✅ Historical or cross-country comparison possible
- ✅ Good for exploratory or background analysis

**Disadvantages:**

- ❌ May not match your exact question
- ❌ You don't control quality or method
- ❌ Can be outdated or biased
- ❌ Check terms of use and citation requirements

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Always evaluate
Who collected it? When? For what purpose? Is it still valid?
:::

## Secondary Data: Common Sources

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Public & Government**

- National statistics offices
- Open data portals (e.g. data.gov)
- UN, World Bank, WHO

**Academic & Research**

- Journals, datasets from papers
- Repositories (e.g. ICPSR, Figshare)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Business & Media**

- Industry reports, market research
- News archives, company filings
- Social media (with API/terms)

**Web**

- Websites, tables, APIs, open data portals
:::
:::

## When to Use Primary vs Secondary?

| Situation | Prefer |
|-----------|--------|
| Quick answer; data already exists | **Secondary** |
| Need very specific metric (e.g. your app's NPS) | **Primary** |
| Budget/time limited | **Secondary** (then refine with primary if needed) |
| Testing cause–effect (e.g. new feature) | **Primary** (experiment) |
| Historical or cross-country comparison | **Secondary** |
| No existing source for your question | **Primary** |

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Best practice
Often **combine**: use secondary data for context, primary for what's missing!
:::

## Part 2: Quantitative vs Qualitative Data 📊

**Two fundamental ways to classify the *nature* of data:**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Quantitative
**Numbers that can be measured or counted**

- Discrete (counts: 1, 2, 3) or continuous (height, temperature)
- You can do **math**: mean, sum, regression
- Examples: age, sales, temperature, score
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Qualitative
**Non-numeric: categories, labels, or text**

- Describes **qualities** or **categories**
- You **count** or **group**; not true "average"
- Examples: gender, country, feedback text, color
:::
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## 💡 Key distinction
**Quantitative** = "how much" or "how many" | **Qualitative** = "what kind" or "which category"
:::

## Quantitative Data in Detail

**Definition:** Data that represent **amounts** or **counts**; can be analyzed with arithmetic.

**Types:**

- **Discrete:** Whole numbers (number of customers, count of clicks, number of products)
- **Continuous:** Can take any value in a range (weight, height, temperature, time)

**Typical analysis:** Mean, median, standard deviation, histograms, scatter plots, regression.

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Rule of thumb
If you can **add** or **average** the values meaningfully, it's quantitative!
:::

## Qualitative Data in Detail

**Definition:** Data that describe **categories**, **labels**, or **qualities**; not meaningful to add or average.

**Types:**

- **Categorical (nominal/ordinal):** Fixed set of labels (gender, country, size: S/M/L)
- **Text (free form):** Open-ended responses, comments, descriptions

**Typical analysis:** Frequency counts, mode, bar charts, grouping, thematic coding (for text).

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 "Male" + "Female" has no numeric meaning; you count how many in each category!
:::

## Primary/Secondary vs Quantitative/Qualitative

**These are different dimensions:**

| | **Primary** | **Secondary** |
|--|-------------|----------------|
| **Quantitative** | Your survey scores, your experiment results | Census numbers, published statistics |
| **Qualitative** | Your interview transcripts, open survey responses | Existing reports, case studies, articles |

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Primary/secondary = *who collected it*. Quantitative/qualitative = *what kind of values* it has.
:::

## Part 3: Levels of Measurement 📐

**Level of measurement** = How much **structure** and **meaning** the values have (affects which statistics and charts are valid).

**Four levels (from least to most structure):**

1. **Nominal** – categories, no order  
2. **Ordinal** – categories with order  
3. **Interval** – numeric, equal gaps, no true zero  
4. **Ratio** – numeric, equal gaps, true zero  

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Choosing the right level tells you: can I average? can I say "twice as much"? can I only count?
:::

## Level 1: Nominal 📌

**Nominal** = Categories with **no order**; names or labels only.

**Examples:** Gender (Male, Female, Other), Country (Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam), Color (Red, Blue), Product type.

**What you can do:** Count, mode, frequency, group by, bar chart.  
**What you cannot do:** Order meaningfully, average, or say "one is greater than another" in a numeric sense.

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Nominal = "named" categories. Order does not matter!
:::

## Level 2: Ordinal 📊

**Ordinal** = Categories with **meaningful order**, but **gaps between levels are not equal**.

**Examples:** Size (S, M, L), Satisfaction (Very dissatisfied … Very satisfied), Education level (Primary, Secondary, University), Ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

**What you can do:** Count, mode, order, median (with care), "greater than / less than".  
**What you cannot do:** Say "the difference between S and M equals the difference between M and L" (unless you define a scale).

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Ordinal = order matters, but **intervals** between levels are not necessarily equal!
:::

## Level 3: Interval 📏

**Interval** = **Numeric** scale with **equal intervals** between values, but **no true zero** (zero does not mean "none").

**Examples:** Temperature in °C or °F (0° is not "no temperature"), calendar year, IQ score (0 is not "no intelligence").

**What you can do:** Add, subtract, mean, standard deviation, line charts.  
**What you cannot do:** Say "twice as hot" or "twice the IQ" (ratio is meaningless because zero is arbitrary).

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Interval = equal gaps; **no meaningful ratio** because zero is not a true zero!
:::

## Level 4: Ratio 📈

**Ratio** = **Numeric** scale with **equal intervals** and a **true zero** (zero = absence of the thing).

**Examples:** Height, weight, age, sales revenue, count of customers, distance.

**What you can do:** Everything for interval **plus** ratios ("twice as heavy", "half the revenue"), geometric mean.

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Ratio = the strongest level; you can meaningfully say "A is twice B"!
:::

## Nominal vs Ordinal vs Interval vs Ratio – Summary

| Level | Order? | Equal gaps? | True zero? | Example | Typical stats |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Nominal** | No | — | — | Country, gender | Count, mode |
| **Ordinal** | Yes | No | — | Size S/M/L, satisfaction | Median, mode |
| **Interval** | Yes | Yes | No | Temperature (°C), year | Mean, SD |
| **Ratio** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Height, revenue, age | Mean, SD, ratios |

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 In practice: nominal/ordinal often **qualitative**; interval/ratio are **quantitative**!
:::

## Why Levels of Measurement Matter

**Wrong statistic for the level → misleading or invalid:**

- **Nominal:** Don't take the "mean" of country or gender.
- **Ordinal:** Mean of "1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High" is sometimes used but interpret with care (assumes equal spacing).
- **Interval:** Ratios ("twice as hot") are not meaningful.
- **Ratio:** Full range of statistics and ratios are valid.

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Always ask: what is the **level** of this variable? Then choose charts and statistics accordingly!
:::

## Part 4: Data Formats 📁

**Data format** = How data is **stored and structured** (file type and rules).

Choosing the right format affects:

- Ease of use in tools (Excel, Python, R, databases)
- Size (compression, readability)
- Structure (flat vs nested, schema)
- Sharing and APIs

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Common formats
CSV, JSON, XML, Excel (.xlsx), and databases (e.g. SQL) are the ones you'll see most!
:::

## CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

**What it is:** Plain text; each line = one row; columns separated by commas (or semicolons).

**Example:**

```text
name,age,city
Alice,25,Phnom Penh
Bob,30,Siem Reap
```

**Pros:** Simple, works everywhere (Excel, Python, R, Google Sheets), small, human-readable  
**Cons:** No nested structure, one "sheet" per file, comma in text needs escaping

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Best for
Tables, spreadsheets, flat lists. Default choice for many analyses!
:::

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

**What it is:** Text-based; uses `{ }` and `[ ]` for objects and arrays. Very common in APIs and web apps.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "city": "Phnom Penh",
  "courses": ["Math", "Stats"]
}
```

**Pros:** Nested structure, widely supported (APIs, Python, R, JavaScript), readable  
**Cons:** Verbose for very large flat tables; less convenient than CSV in Excel

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Best for
API responses, configs, nested or hierarchical data!
:::

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

**What it is:** Tag-based markup; elements and attributes define structure.

**Example:**

```xml
<person>
  <name>Alice</name>
  <age>25</age>
  <city>Phnom Penh</city>
</person>
```

**Pros:** Structured, schema (XSD), used in legacy systems and some reports  
**Cons:** Verbose, heavier than JSON for similar content; parsing a bit more work

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Best for
Legacy systems, documents with strict schema, some government/data feeds!
:::

## Excel (.xlsx) and Spreadsheets

**What it is:** Binary (or OOXML) format; multiple sheets, formulas, formatting.

**Pros:** Familiar in business, multiple sheets, charts, formulas  
**Cons:** Not ideal for automation or very large data; programmatic handling needs libraries (e.g. `openpyxl`, `pandas`)

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Best for
Reports, dashboards, manual editing. For analysis pipelines, CSV or JSON often better!
:::

## Other Formats (Brief)

| Format | Typical use |
|--------|-------------|
| **TSV** | Like CSV but tab-separated; good when commas appear in text |
| **YAML** | Configs, readable; less common as main data store |
| **Parquet / Feather** | Columnar; fast for big data (e.g. pandas, Spark) |
| **SQL / Databases** | Relational data; query with SQL; best for large, multi-table data |

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Rule of thumb
**Share & analyze tables** → CSV or JSON. **APIs** → JSON. **Enterprise/big data** → Parquet, DB.
:::

## Choosing a Data Format

| Need | Good choice |
|------|-------------|
| Simple table, Excel users | CSV |
| API or nested structure | JSON |
| Multiple sheets, formulas | Excel (.xlsx) |
| Legacy / formal schema | XML |
| Large analytics, pipelines | Parquet, database |
| Config / readability | YAML (for config), JSON (for data) |

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Match format to your tool and audience!
:::

## Part 5: Data Types in Practice 📐

**Data type** = The **kind** of value a variable or column holds; links to **quantitative/qualitative** and **levels of measurement**.

::: {.callout-important}
## 💡 Why data types matter
- **Analysis:** Nominal data → count, mode; interval/ratio → mean, SD. Wrong type → wrong result!
- **Storage:** Numbers and dates stored correctly enable correct operations
- **Visualization:** Nominal/ordinal → bar charts; interval/ratio → histograms, line charts
:::

## Data Types: Overview (Link to Levels)

| Type | Level of measurement | Examples | Typical operations |
|------|----------------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Numeric** (int, float) | Interval / Ratio | 42, 3.14, age, revenue | Mean, median, sum, histograms |
| **Categorical** (nominal) | Nominal | "Male", "Cambodia" | Count, mode, bar chart |
| **Categorical** (ordinal) | Ordinal | "S", "M", "L"; satisfaction 1–5 | Count, median, ordered bar chart |
| **Datetime** | Often interval | 2024-01-15, 14:30 | Sort, diff, time series |
| **Text** (string) | Qualitative | Comments, descriptions | Count, thematic coding |
| **Boolean** | Often nominal | True, False | Count, filter |

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Nominal/ordinal → qualitative. Interval/ratio → quantitative. Set types correctly in pandas/R!
:::

## Data Type: Numeric (Integer & Float)

**Integer (int):** Whole numbers – counts, IDs, ages in years.

- Examples: `1`, `0`, `-5`, `1000`
- Operations: sum, mean, median, min, max, histograms

**Float (float):** Numbers with decimals – prices, rates, measurements.

- Examples: `3.14`, `0.5`, `-2.7`, `99.99`
- Same operations as int; also rounding, precision

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Don't store numbers as text! "123" + "456" = "123456", not 579. Convert to int/float for math.
:::

## Data Type: Categorical (Nominal vs Ordinal)

**Categorical** = A fixed set of labels; maps to **nominal** or **ordinal** level of measurement.

**Nominal** – no order: gender, country, product name.

- Examples: "Male", "Female"; "Cambodia", "Thailand"
- Operations: count, mode, group by, bar chart

**Ordinal** – meaningful order: size, rating, education level.

- Examples: "Small", "Medium", "Large"; "Low", "Medium", "High"
- Operations: count, mode, median (with care), ordered bar chart

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 In pandas: use `category` dtype; for ordinal you can set order with `pd.Categorical(..., ordered=True)`
:::

## Data Type: Datetime

**Datetime** = Date and/or time.

- Examples: `2024-01-15`, `2024-01-15 14:30:00`, "January 15, 2024"
- Operations: sort, filter by range, difference (e.g. days between), aggregate by month/year

**Why type matters:** If stored as text, "2024-01-10" might sort after "2024-01-9" (string sort). As datetime, order is correct.

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 In Python: `pd.to_datetime()`; in R: `as.Date()`, `lubridate`. Always check timezone if relevant!
:::

## Data Type: Text (String)

**Text (string)** = Sequence of characters – names, descriptions, comments.

- Examples: "Alice", "Phnom Penh", long paragraphs
- Operations: length, search, replace, split, sentiment (with NLP)
- Often **not** used in numeric models directly; you may extract features (e.g. word count, sentiment score) or encode (e.g. TF-IDF)

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 For analysis: decide if a column is really "text" or should be **categorical** (limited unique values) or **numeric** (if it's a number stored as text)
:::

## Data Type: Boolean

**Boolean** = True or False (or 1/0, Yes/No).

- Examples: `True`, `False`; "Yes", "No"; 1, 0
- Operations: filter (e.g. keep only True), count, sum (count of True), logic (AND, OR)

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Useful for flags: "is_active", "purchased", "opted_in". Convert "Yes"/"No" to True/False for clarity in code
:::

## Data Type vs Data Format

| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Data format** | How data is **stored** (file structure) | CSV, JSON, Excel |
| **Data type** | **Kind** of each value (semantics) | int, float, category, datetime, string |

**Same format, different types:** A CSV can have columns that are numbers, dates, and text. The **format** is CSV; each **column** has a **type**.

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 When loading data, you often must **set or convert** types (e.g. "date" column → datetime; "id" → int)
:::

## Type Conversion (Coercion)

**Converting one type to another:**

- **String → Number:** `int("42")`, `float("3.14")` (Python); `as.numeric()` (R)
- **Number → String:** `str(42)` (Python); `as.character()` (R)
- **String → Datetime:** `pd.to_datetime(df["date"])` (pandas); `as.Date()`, `lubridate` (R)
- **Categorical:** `df["size"] = df["size"].astype("category")` (pandas); `factor()` (R)

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Invalid values (e.g. "abc" to int) cause errors. Clean or handle missing/invalid data first!
:::

## Why Data Types Matter for Analysis

**Wrong type → wrong result:**

- **Averaging "1","2","3" as text** → error or nonsense (e.g. concatenation)
- **Sorting dates as text** → "2024-01-9" after "2024-01-10"
- **Using "Male"/"Female" as numbers** → meaningless mean

**Right type → correct analysis:**

- Numeric → mean, median, regression, histograms
- Categorical → counts, bar charts, group by
- Datetime → time series, trends, period comparisons

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Always inspect `dtypes` (pandas) or `str()` (R) after loading data!
:::

## Data Types: Summary Table

| Type | Python (pandas) | R | Use for |
|------|------------------|---|--------|
| Integer | `int64` | integer | Counts, IDs |
| Float | `float64` | numeric | Prices, rates |
| Categorical | `category` | factor | Groups, labels |
| Datetime | `datetime64` | Date/POSIXct | Dates, times |
| Text | `object`/string | character | Names, free text |
| Boolean | `bool` | logical | Flags |

::: {.callout-note}
## 📋 Setting types explicitly when reading (e.g. `dtype=` in pandas) avoids surprises later!
:::

## Converting Between Formats (Recap)

**In practice:**

- **Python:** `pandas` reads CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.; write back to any of them
- **R:** `readr`, `jsonlite`, `readxl` for read; `write_csv`, etc. for write
- **Excel:** Save As → CSV; or use Power Query / scripts for JSON

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Typical workflow
Load data (CSV/JSON/API) → **set correct types** (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) → analyze and visualize!
:::

## Practice Exercise 1 🏋️

**Primary vs Secondary**

For each scenario, say whether you'd start with **primary** or **secondary** data (and why in one sentence):

1. "What is the average satisfaction score of *our* app users?"
2. "How did GDP per capita change in ASEAN countries over the last 10 years?"
3. "Does our new checkout button increase conversions?"

::: {.callout-caution}
## ✏️ Your Turn
Take 3 minutes. Discuss with a partner!
:::

## Sample Answer: Exercise 1

1. **Our app satisfaction** → **Primary** (only we can survey our users; no one else has this for our product).
2. **GDP in ASEAN** → **Secondary** (national/international statistics already exist, e.g. World Bank).
3. **New checkout button** → **Primary** (we run an A/B experiment on our site and collect conversion data).

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Notice
Question 2 could use secondary + primary if we later survey *why* people think GDP changed!
:::

## Practice Exercise 2 🏋️

**Data formats**

You receive:

- A) A table of 5,000 customers: id, name, email, signup_date  
- B) API response with nested objects: user → profile → preferences  
- C) A report with 3 sheets: Summary, Sales by Region, Product List  

Suggest one main format for **storing or sharing** each (CSV, JSON, Excel, or other). Why?

::: {.callout-caution}
## ✏️ Your Turn (2 minutes)
:::

## Sample Answer: Exercise 2

- **A) Customer table** → **CSV** (flat, tabular, easy in Excel and pandas).
- **B) API nested response** → **JSON** (keeps structure; APIs usually give JSON).
- **C) Multi-sheet report** → **Excel** (multiple sheets, summary + tables; good for human readers). If only for code, could export each sheet as CSV.

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 No single "best" format
It depends on who uses it and which tools they use!
:::

## Practice Exercise 3 🏋️

**Quantitative vs Qualitative & Levels of Measurement**

For each variable, say: (1) **Quantitative or Qualitative**, (2) **Level** (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio), (3) **One valid statistic or chart**.

| Variable | Example values |
|----------|----------------|
| gender | Male, Female, Other |
| satisfaction | 1 = Very dissatisfied … 5 = Very satisfied |
| temperature (°C) | 20, 25, 30 |
| revenue ($) | 100, 500, 1000 |

::: {.callout-caution}
## ✏️ Your Turn (3 minutes)
:::

## Sample Answer: Exercise 3

| Variable | Quant/Qual | Level | Statistic or chart |
|----------|------------|-------|--------------------|
| gender | Qualitative | Nominal | Count, mode, bar chart |
| satisfaction | Qualitative (or treated as quantitative) | Ordinal | Median, mode, ordered bar chart |
| temperature (°C) | Quantitative | Interval | Mean, SD, line chart (no "twice as hot") |
| revenue ($) | Quantitative | Ratio | Mean, sum, "twice as much", histogram |

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Temperature has no true zero (0°C ≠ no heat); revenue has true zero → ratio!
:::

## Key Takeaways 🎯

**Primary vs Secondary**

- **Primary** = you collect for your purpose (surveys, experiments, etc.).
- **Secondary** = already collected by others (reports, databases, web).
- Often **combine** both.

**Quantitative vs Qualitative**

- **Quantitative** = numbers you can measure/count; mean, sum, regression.
- **Qualitative** = categories or text; count, mode, group by.

**Levels of measurement**

- **Nominal** = categories, no order (e.g. country, gender).
- **Ordinal** = order, gaps not equal (e.g. S/M/L, satisfaction).
- **Interval** = numeric, equal gaps, no true zero (e.g. temperature °C).
- **Ratio** = numeric, true zero (e.g. height, revenue, age).

**Data formats & types**

- **CSV/JSON/Excel** for storage; set **correct types** (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) so analysis and charts are valid!

::: {.callout-important}
## 💪 Next step
Practice: load a CSV, identify primary/secondary, quantitative/qualitative, and nominal/ordinal/interval/ratio for each column!
